# Count occurences of a letter in a string

Open countOccurences.js{{open}}

Here, you must complete the for loop parameters and instruction so that occurences is displayed with the correct value.

For each letter of the string, you need to test if the letter is an 'e'. If this is the case you must increment 'occurrences'

Don't forget you can iterate on strings like you would do it on an array (1st letter is index 0, then 2nd letter is index 1, etc.)
